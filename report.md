# The comparison of neighbourhoods in New York, Toronto and San Francisco

## Author: David Golob

## 1. Introduction

In this project we analyize the similarities between three cities: Toronto, New York and San Francisco. 
The purpose of the project is to determine which cities are more similar to each other.
The idea is that we obtain the data about venues in each of cities' neighbourhoods. Based on this data we can cluster neighbourhoods in each city, then
we can compare cluster centroids between each city and clculate similarity measure.


## 2. Data

to obtain data for various venues in each neighborhoods. The venue data was then used in cluseter analysis.
